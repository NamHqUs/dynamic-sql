# NorthStar Health Group: dynamic query showcase

NorthStar is a fictional, nationwide health company: it sells health and wellness
products, provides care through clinics, underwrites its own health plans, and
employs the clinicians, sales teams, agents, and support staff behind those
services. `northstar-demo.sqlite.sql` creates the shared SQLite database and
loads its demo data. The seed is realistic **synthetic data**, not a dump of
actual patient, employee, or customer records. Every report below returns 10
rows against the included seed and uses `LIMIT 10` for a compact demo.

The four domains deliberately share `Persons`, `Employees`, `Locations`, and
their relationships. This lets a demo show dynamic projections and aliases,
expression filters, nested joins, aggregates, `HAVING`, subqueries, and window
functions against one realistic scenario rather than four unrelated schemas.

## Research and demo plan

The use cases reflect common operational questions and metrics found in
industry and regulatory guidance:

- **Sales:** revenue and margin by product/channel, customer value, and
  representative performance, following the sales profitability breakdowns in
  [Microsoft's sales and profitability analytics example](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/analytics/sales-profitability-performance-content-pack).
- **Health care:** clinic utilization, physician workload, and lab outcomes,
  aligned with practice-operation benchmarks from
  [MGMA](https://www.mgma.com/articles/foundational-benchmarks-and-kpis-for-medical-practice-operations-in-2023).
- **Insurance:** claim status, denial patterns, premiums, paid claims, and a
  simplified medical-loss ratio; real MLR reporting has specific regulatory
  definitions and adjustments, documented in the
  [CMS MLR resources](https://www.cms.gov/marketplace/resources/data/medical-loss-ratio-data-systems-resources).
- **HR:** headcount, compensation, performance, workforce mix, and leave,
  commonly used people-analytics measures described by
  [SHRM](https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/organizational-and-employee-development/pages/hr-metrics-that-matter-most.aspx).

The demo story is: NorthStar sells wellness products to the same people who may
receive care at its clinics and enroll in its insurance plans. Employees connect
the business units as sales representatives, clinicians, insurance agents, and
HR-managed teams. The implementation plan is to (1) establish shared identity,
employee, department, and clinic entities, (2) connect sales orders, clinical
visits/labs, insurance policies/claims/payments, and HR reviews/leaves, (3) seed
enough related records for top-ten grouped reports, and (4) validate all reports
against the SQLite seed and foreign-key constraints.

The data is intentionally invented but plausible and repeatable so the demo is
safe to publish and does not expose protected health or employee information.
The plan comparison in the query pack is a demonstration ratio, not a compliant
regulatory MLR calculation.

Compare sales channels across product categories, including net revenue,
discounts, gross profit, order count, and average basket value.

           ROUND(SUM(Revenue) OVER (ORDER BY SalesMonth), 2) AS RunningRevenue
    FROM monthly
    ORDER BY SalesMonth DESC
